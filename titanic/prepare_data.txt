task 1: data prep
1) read csv with structured data from data into pandas dataframe and perform the following:
- file with training data is data\train.csv and test data is data\test.csv

task 2: data cleaning:
1) Handle Missing Values: 
- Identify columns with missing data and impute values where possible. 
- For numerical columns, consider using the median or mean. 
- For categorical columns, consider using the mode or a designated placeholder. 
- If a column has too many missing values, you may opt to drop it.

2)  Outlier Detection and Treatment
- If numerical columns contain extreme outliers, consider capping or transforming values to reduce their influence.

task 3: train model
1)  use catboost to train the model with Transported being the target.
remarks:
- split the training data and use a fraction of the data to test the accuracy of the model
- output trained model to file in /kaggle/working/
